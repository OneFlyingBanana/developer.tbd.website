      description:
        'Decision-making is open by default, with rare exceptions made for security, compliance, personnel, or other sensitive issues. Projects under TBDâ€™s stewardship will conduct design, roadmap, issues, bugs, and code reviews in public. This is critical for accountability and to promote the inclusive environment necessary for project success.',

        'Projects need well-defined scope to succeed. They also need accessible, comprehensive documentation, a stellar Getting Started experience, and well-defined expectations. TBD fosters an environment built for contribution without personal intervention. Newcomers should be able to follow the project status on their own without additional explanation.',
