# The web democratized how we connect with each other and information. But it was never built with an identity layer. tbDEX changes this.

We struggle to secure personal data with hundreds of log-ins and passwords that we can’t remember. We also cede our personal data to third parties and trust them as custodians.

tbDEX is a decentralized, permissionless protocol. It opens the door to self-sovereign identity and access to the financial system for all. And because the platform abstracts decentralization’s complexity away, you can focus on building great things.

# Use Cases

## Proving Your Identity

Alice holds a digital wallet that securely manages all aspects of her identity, including her identifiers, credentials, and authorizations for external apps and entities. Alice uses her wallet to request USD in exchange for 100 units of cryptocurrency. Because Alice is off-ramping from cryptocurrency to fiat, most Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) are required to verify Alice’s identity in order to fulfill their regulatory and compliance obligations. PFIs that are interested in fulfilling Alice’s request reply with a bid as well as their identity verification requirements for fulfillment. Alice chooses a bid which will need Know Your Customer (KYC) information (such as name, address, date of birth). Alice has already provided all of the necessary information to another PFI in the past. So Alice allows her wallet to provide a verifiable credential issued from the past PFI to the bidding PFI, along with the cryptocurrency to exchange. The PFI verifies the credential and continues with fulfillment.

## On-and-Off Ramps Between Fiat and Crypto

Alice holds a digital wallet. Through the wallet's user interface, Alice requests cryptocurrency in exchange for $100 USD. The wallet broadcasts Alice's request to Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) who may possibly fulfill it. Interested PFIs respond to the wallet with bids for Alice's request. Each bid is accompanied with credential requirements. Alice (or the wallet) chooses a bid and allows the wallet to provide Alice’s credentials requested by the PFI. Once a bid is accepted and credentials verified, Alice's wallet makes a payment, and the PFI executes a smart contract to release the crypto to Alice’s wallet address.

## Data Self-Ownership

Bob holds a digital wallet and has granted it access to his transaction history, credentials, and other relevant preferences that are in his personal data store. Bob likes his wallet but is tempted to switch to a different one that has a feature his current wallet lacks. Bob downloads the new wallet and grants it permission to access his transactions, cryptocurrency balances, and dark mode preference from his data store. Bob uses both wallets for a week and the data seamlessly syncs across the wallets. Bob decides that he prefers his old wallet over the new one. He revokes all permissions granted to the new wallet and uninstalls it.
