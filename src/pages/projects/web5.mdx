# WEB5: AN EXTRA DECENTRALIZED WEB PLATFORM

## Building an extra decentralized web that puts you in control of your data and identity

The web democratized the exchange of information, but it's missing a key layer: identity. On the web of today, identity and personal data have become the property of third parties, leaving us without agency in the digital world.

Web5 brings decentralized identity and data storage to the web we all care so much about. It lets devs focus on creating delightful user experiences, while seamlessly returning ownership of identity and data to individuals.

Web2, Web3 â†’ Web5. It's the best of where we've been and what we've learned.

### Actors

- Wallets: wallets act as agents for individuals or institutions by facilitating identity and data interactions.
- Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs): personal datastores that hold public and encrypted user data.
- Decentralized Web Apps (DWAs): web apps enhanced with decentralized identity and data storage capabilities.

### Use Cases

Control Your Identity

Alice holds a digital wallet that securely manages her identity, data, and authorizations for external apps and connections. Alice uses her wallet to sign in to a new decentralized social media app. Because Alice has connected to the app with her decentralized identity, she does not need to create a profile, and all the connections, relationships, and posts she creates through the app are stored with her, in her Decentralized Web Nodes. Now Alice can switch apps whenever she wants, taking her social persona with her.

Own Your Data

Bob is a music lover and hates having his personal data locked to a single vendor. It forces him to regurgitate his playlists and songs over and over again across different music apps. Thankfully there's a way out of this maze of vendor-locked silos: Bob can keep this data in his Decentralized Web Nodes. This way Bob is able to grant any music app access to his settings and preferences, enabling him to take his personalized music experience wherever he chooses.
