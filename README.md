# TBD Developer Site

We build decentralized platforms, protocols, and tools that empower every individual to own their data and participate in the global economy.

## Getting started

This project was boostrapped with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

### Development Dependencies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) — v16.14.2, latest LTS at project kickoff

### Development Setup

Install application dependencies by executing the following within the root of the repository:

```shell
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Development Mode

The following command will run the application in development mode and open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view it in your browser.

```shell
npm run start
```

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see lint errors in the console. The Docusaurus Remote Content plugin has a tendency to end up in a continuous loop of retrieving files. When this occurs, restart the development server.

### Production Build

The following command will build the application for production. Contents will be generated within the `/build` directory.

```shell
npm run build
```
