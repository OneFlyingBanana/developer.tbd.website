Our goal is to bring all interested parties together to document use cases and requirements, create diagrams, propose and influence standards in existing standards organizations, and work towards building real-world, standards-based, interoperable software.

The working group will first be focused on use cases around tbDEX: any credentials that may be used in a decentralized exchange interaction such as those around Know Your Customer (KYC)/Know Your Business (KYB), Identity Verification (IDV), and risk scoring. Weâ€™ll be building off of existing standards work in the [W3C](http://w3.org/) and [DIF](http://identity.foundation/), and others, as well as influencing nascent standards initiatives such as the recently kicked off [Trust Establishment](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/trust-establishment), and soon to be kicked off [Schema Directory](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/claims-credentials/blob/main/work_items/schema_directory.md) work items in the [DIF Claims and Credentials Working Group](https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html).

This meeting reoccurs every other Tuesday.
